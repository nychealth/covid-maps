# Improving data visualization accessibility
This folder describes ways to improve the accessibility of the NYC DOHMH's COVID-19 pages. These pages feature proper use of headings, semantic HTML, color contrast, and other standard techniques. They also feature techniques for improving the accessibility for users with visual impairments. These techniques include:
- Hiding visualizations from screen readers using the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute 
- Offering data tables (which are more accessible, though not perfect) in parallel to the visualizations, but hidden from sighted users with a screen-reader-only class that positions them off screen.

[The page in this repository](https://nychealth.github.io/covid-maps/accessibility/index.html) offers an example of these techniques.
